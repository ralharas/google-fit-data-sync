FOR MAC USERS - IMPORTANT!

When you try to open GoogleFitSync, you'll see a security warning.

HERE'S HOW TO FIX IT (30 seconds):

1. Right-click on "GoogleFitSync" 
2. Choose "Open" from the menu
3. Click "Open" when asked "Are you sure?"

That's it! The app will work normally after this one-time step.

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
Mac blocks apps that aren't from the App Store or signed developers.
This is normal and the app is completely safe.
