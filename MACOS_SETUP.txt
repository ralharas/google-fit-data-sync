FOR MAC USERS - IMPORTANT!

When you try to open GoogleFitSync, you'll see a security warning.

IF RIGHT-CLICK → OPEN DOESN'T WORK, TRY THIS:

METHOD 1 - System Preferences:
1. Try to open GoogleFitSync (it will be blocked)
2. Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → General
3. Look for "GoogleFitSync was blocked because..."
4. Click "Open Anyway"
5. Confirm when asked

METHOD 2 - Terminal (if Method 1 fails):
1. Open Terminal (Applications → Utilities → Terminal)
2. Type: xattr -cr 
3. Drag the GoogleFitSync file into Terminal
4. Press Enter
5. Now try opening GoogleFitSync normally

That's it! The app will work normally after this one-time step.

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
Mac blocks apps that aren't from the App Store or signed developers.
This is normal and the app is completely safe.
