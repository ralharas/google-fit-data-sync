FOR WINDOWS USERS - IMPORTANT!

You might see a security warning when downloading or running GoogleFitSync.exe.

POSSIBLE WARNINGS & HOW TO FIX:

1. BROWSER DOWNLOAD WARNING:
   - Click "Keep" or "Download anyway"
   - This is normal for new/unsigned apps

2. WINDOWS DEFENDER SMARTSCREEN:
   - If you see "Windows protected your PC"
   - Click "More info"
   - Click "Run anyway"

3. ANTIVIRUS WARNING:
   - If your antivirus blocks the file
   - Add GoogleFitSync.exe to your antivirus "exceptions" or "whitelist"

That's it! The app will work normally after this one-time step.

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
Windows blocks apps that aren't digitally signed by recognized publishers.
This is normal and the app is completely safe.
